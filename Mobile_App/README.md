# VerifEye Mobile Application

## Flutter installation
Since our application was built using the Dart with the Flutter UI toolkit  you will need to have flutter installed to build and run it. Instructions to do so can be found here, [Flutter Installation Instructions](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)

## Compilation (Terminal)
To compile the VerifEye application ensure you are in the eye_spy directory and use the command 
```bash
flutter pub get
```
In order to get the required dependencies. Now use the command
```bash
flutter run
```
In order to build the application and send the apk to a connected emulator or debugging device.

Additional info can be found [on the flutter docs website](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/test-drive?tab=terminal)
